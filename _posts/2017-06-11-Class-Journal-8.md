How to make a cup of tea

Making a cup of tea is easy and is known as a simple thing to do; right? Not in the eyes of the a computer however. 

In our lesson this week, instead of doing codecademy we talked about making tea and how a computer knows how to do that. But how do you make tea.

* Turn the tap on 

* Pour the water into the kettle

* Boil the water

* Pour the water into a mug

* Put the tea bag into the mug

* Stir

* Add milk

* Stir 

In that short list there are many things that a computer could not identify and would find confusing. So if you wanted a robot to make you a cup of tea you would have to create a function for every word. For example if you wanted your robot to turn the tap on you would have to have a function list within the word "Turn": Swivel your wrist anticlockwise.

 You would also have to consider the area your robot is operating in. If your mug is too far the robot will not be able to reach and if it is too short the mug will be knocked over.

However even if you managed to program your robot to pour a cup of tea for you and you wanted to produce for any home you would have to create even more functions and the robot would need to sense what type of tap it is.

To conclude, I don't think making a cup of tea is as easy as we think it is, for everyone.
