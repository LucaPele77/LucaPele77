Codecademy

Today we started a new project called codecademy. It teaches us how to code in the language of Python and it takes us through all the different steps of python. Today we started on Python syntax and some of us got onto the strings section. This week was very informative as we also learnt at the end of the project we would learn how to code a game which should we good fun!
