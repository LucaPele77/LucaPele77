IT Half term progress

Started: 23%

Finished: 33%

Topics cleared: Pig latin

What I found hard.

I found that functions was the hardest I found during my time coding during the half term. I didn't take any of the quizzes however and I may do them later to remember the topics when it comes to doing the final topic. I especially found on beyond strings quite difficult but it became quite easily eventually.
