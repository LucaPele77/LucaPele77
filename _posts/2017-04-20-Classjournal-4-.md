Fuze box

During this lesson we got onto cables. We had to put in a code and then try to get an LED to light up. At the start my partner and I found it very difficult and we weren't sure how to work it but after a little help from Mr Tansley we managed it. We then moved on to making a circle on our screen getting bigger. To do this it was easy as you simply had to code it, wire it properly and then put a light on one of the components and the circle would grow much bigger. My partner and I also experimented with the colour.
