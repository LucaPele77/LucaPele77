Fuze box

In today's lesson we got the breadboxes out. To set them up all we had to do was grab one connect it to a hdmi port and add in the keyboard and mouse. We then started the basics which consisted of saying "hello world." After we had setup our fuze box and done that it was the end of our lesson. My partner and I found it quite easy and we are hoping to make good progress next lesson.
