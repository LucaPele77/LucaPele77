**Google spreadsheet work**

When I first heard we were doing google spreadsheets, I was excited but at the same time I was a bit apprehensions because I knew it would be a hard challenge.

I began the lesson by starting to write my stock which was relatively easily but I began to face a challenge when I began writing the Vlookup for my stock. The Vlookup essentially can look up the price of what item I have selected. In my spreadsheet the Vlookup looks like this: (=iferror(vlookup(F2,$A$2:$B$7,2,false),). Crucially in the code the 'False,' allows the Vlookup not to worry about the alphabetical order of the stock. 

After I had calculated the price of all of the order, which you can do by timesing the quantity of the product by the price of it, I could calculate the price if there was a certain discount. My only question is how I would do a discount if there only was a discount on one item.
