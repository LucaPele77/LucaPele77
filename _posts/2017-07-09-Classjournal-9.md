Codecademy

Today in the lesson I was doing functions and how we define them. What I actually had to do was plan a holiday. This included where I was going, how long I was staying for and also how much each different place would cost. I struggled at the start to try to understand how to do the things codecademy asked me to do as an extra however after reading through the instructions again and reading what I had written, I understood.
