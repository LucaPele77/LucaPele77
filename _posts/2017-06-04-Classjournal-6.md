Codecademy

Today we continued with our codecademy. I managed to finish strings and made it to the start of conditionals and control flow. Also Mr Keen helped me as he told me to read it more carefully and I managed to do it properly. I enjoyed this week of codecademy more than the last, because it gave me a bigger and harder challenge. By then it was the end of the lesson.
