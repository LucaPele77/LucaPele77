Fuze box 

During this lesson my partner and I went on to our bread box and started a game called girls and boys. The basic premise of the game was that we would give the girls an amount and we would give the boys an amount. We could then minus the boys from the girls and we could also add them. My partner and I can get through code very quickly because we work very well together and we have a good system.
