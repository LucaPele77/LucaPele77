This lesson my partner and I made another game. We were fortunate enough that Mr Atkinson came into our lesson and we got to let him have a try. The game consisted of 100 numbers and 10 guesses. The aim of the game was to guess the number and when you got it wrong the game would tell you either higher or lower. To beat the game you only had to go in the middle therefore it was much easier to find the number. My partner and I also altered the code so it was harder to guess
